                        Giambattisa Bodoni designed the Bodoni typeface in 1798 but has since undergone many revisions. It is a popular typeface for movie posters and logos, including the famous “CK” for Calvin Klein. It may seem similar to Baskerville, an earlier serif typeface on this list. This is because Bodoni furtively agreed with Baskerville’s methods of increasing legibility through thicker vertical lines and drastically contrasting weights of opposing strokes. Legendary designer Massimo Vignelli who famously preferred Helvetica, claims that “Bodoni is one of the most elegant typefaces ever designed.”
