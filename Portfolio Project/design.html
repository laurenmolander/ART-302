“The Making of the Dark Side of the Moon”, 2023. 8” x 8”, Adobe InDesign
<br>
This project, while it seemed like a total chore at first, led me to creating one of my favorite pieces I’ve done so far. We were assigned to make a book on a documentary that we had watched, and to integrate the aesthetic appeal of said film into our imagery, typography, and color palette. Being the classic rock snob that my dad raised me to be, I picked a documentary about the making of one of my favorite albums of all time, the Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. I’m super into 70’s graphic design, so I used it as heavy inspiration for my book. I also took elements of album cover design from that era and applied it to the aesthetic appeal of the entire book. I am so proud of it, and I think it was a great opportunity to integrate my personal interests with a class project, which is something I am rarely able to do as a designer.

    “Frank Lloyd Wright Races”, 8.5” x 11”, 2023, Adobe Illustrator
    <br>
Over the summer, I was asked to create a design that would be considered as the logo for this year’s Frank Lloyd Wright races in Oak Park Illinois. While the team ended up going with another design, I like to showcase this piece because it was a project that required a lot of adaptability on my part. I was limited in what colors I could use, and had to incorporate the iconic elements of Prairie Style architecture into this design. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and it strengthened my skills in working with restrictions.

    “A Short Guide to France”, 2023. 7.5” x 7.5”, Adobe Illustrator & Adobe  InDesign, Cardstock, Saddle-Bound. <br>
This little book has been quite possibly the most challenging project I have been assigned so far. The book was an assignment I received in my Graphic Design III class where each student was asked to create a forty page informational book about a country of their choice, all while using a limited color palette and integrating illustrative and informational elements. It took us about a month and a half to complete and forced me to make a lot of creative choices and compromises that I had never explored before. However, I am very happy with the result and though the difficult process of making this book come together I have developed a new skillset and outlook as a designer, illustrator, and communicator.
