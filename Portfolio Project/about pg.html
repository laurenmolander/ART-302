<p id="about">
Lauren Molander is currently a junior at the Wonsook 
Kim School of Arts at Illinois State University pursuing 
a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design and expects to 
graduate in the spring of 2025. Born and raised in Geneva 
Illinois on the outskirts of Chicago, she uses the rich 
artistic scene that she grew up with as a primary influence 
in her work. She focuses on compositional design and illustration 
and likes to integrate the two in her body of work. Lauren works in primarily digital formats, most notably Adobe InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop as well as ClipStudio paint for illustrative endeavors. 
 <br>

She primarily focuses on creating and integrating aesthetics with experimental composition and is working to apply these skills in a professional editorial context. She has worked alongside local businesses such Butter Twice and Again Consignment in Normal, Illinois to create promotional materials and created branding materials that were considered for the 2023 Frank Lloyd Wright races in Oak Park. Additionally, Lauren is pursuing a French and Francophone studies minor along with her BFA, and aspires to use her design skills and language proficiency to pursue a career in international design and art direction.
<br>

When she is not creating, Lauren  likes to look around secondhand stores to find unique trinkets and articles of clothing to inspire future projects.  As well as being a full-time student, Lauren is currently employed as a graphic design intern for Illinois State University’s Career Services division and is responsible for creating marketing materials to promote services, events, and working to uphold brand identity through design.
