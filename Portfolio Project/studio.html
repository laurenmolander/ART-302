My first art show! This semester I had the privilege of being a part of the “What Grounds You?” (hehe, get it? Because it was at a coffee shop?? How silly) art show my ART 351 class hosted at Coffeehouse in Uptown Normal this October! We were asked to display a piece of art we had made previously that represented something that was a source of comfort and strength to us, so, of course, I picked a piece I painted of me and my lovely dog, Olive. This piece holds a special place in my heart, because I made it in a single night for my painting class last year in my school’s art building with my classmates, some of whom have become good friends of mine. As a graphic design student, I spend a lot of time staring at a screen fighting with Adobe InDesign and Illustrator, so getting opportunities to express myself in different mediums like painting is such a nice change from what I’m used to.

This was the first painting I ever made for a college class. The assignment was to illustrate a book cover that highlighted a moment, person, or thing that was a critically important part of our lives. I chose to illustrate my grandma’s old dog who I spent lots of time with as a child. I love to acknowledge my early years in my work with small motifs, and this assignment gave me the perfect opportunity to exercise this. This painting now sits in the kitchen of my grandma’s house!
